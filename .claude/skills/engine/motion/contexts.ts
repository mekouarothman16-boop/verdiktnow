/**
 * Motion seed types — five named animation feels, each with five reusable contexts.
 *
 * A seed is a complete personality (Spring, Silk, Snap, Float, Pulse).
 * A context is where that personality lands: entrance, exit, hover, press, layout.
 * Each context returns props you can spread directly onto a `<motion.X>` — and
 * multiple contexts compose because every transition is embedded inside its
 * own state object (animate / exit / whileHover / whileTap) rather than
 * sitting at the top level where it would collide.
 *
 * Example:
 *   <motion.button {...spring.hover} {...spring.press}>Save</motion.button>
 *   <AnimatePresence>
 *     {open && <motion.div {...silk.entrance} {...silk.exit} />}
 *   </AnimatePresence>
